# Design-Tools
This repository describes the design tools that you may need while working on Mi-V Hardware platform.

## Libero


### Libero SoC PolarFire
[Libero SoC PolarFire](https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/design-resources/3863-libero-soc-polarfire) Design Suite offers high productivity with its comprehensive, easy-to-learn, easy-to-adopt development tools for designing with Microsemi's PolarFire FPGA Family.

### Libero SoC
[Libero SoC](https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/design-resources/1750-libero-soc) should be used for designing with Microsemi IGLOO2, SmartFusion2, SmartFusion, IGLOO, ProASIC3 and Fusion families. Libero Design Software integrates industry leading synthesis, debug and DSP support from Synopsys, and simulation from Mentor Graphics with power analysis, timing analysis and push button design flow.

### Libero IDE
[Libero IDE](https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/design-resources/1751-libero-ide) should be used for designing with Microsemi antifuse and legacy flash FPGAs. Libero Design Software integrates industry leading synthesis, debug and DSP support from Synopsys, and simulation from Mentor Graphics with power analysis, timing analysis and push button design flow.

## FlashPro
[FlashPro](https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/programming/4977-flashpro) is the In-System programming & debug hardware for Microsemi flash-based FPGAs & SoCs. The Microsemi FlashPro programming system is a combination of Microsemi's FlashPro software and a hardware programmers.

## SoftConsole
[SoftConsole](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/SoftConsole) is Microsemi's free Eclipse/CDT and GNU MCU Eclipse based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) provided as key part of the Microsemi Mi-V Embedded Ecosystem. SoftConsole supports development and debugging of bare metal and RTOS based RISC-V and Arm Cortex-M software in C, C++ and assembler using industry standard GNU tools including GCC, GDB, binutils running on Windows and Linux. SoftConsole supports embedded debugging over JTAG using the Microsemi FlashPro programmer and OpenOCD.
